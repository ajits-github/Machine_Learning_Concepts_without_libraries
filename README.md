# Machine_Learning_Concepts_without_libraries
An interesting repo where we see basic machine learning concepts without using any pre-built libraries like scikit-learn etc.


There are many machine learning concepts that we use daily in our neural networks without knowing their actual implementation. These concepts are being used in different domains of AI e.g. in NLP, Computer Vision, Time Series, Spam detection, etc. Some of the below concepts/techniques that we will be looking into detail **without using any in-built libraries**:
* Bag of Words (CountVectorizer from scikit-learn)
* Tf-idf
* Word embeddings
* PCA
* KNN
  - An interesting use case where we want to do image classification using KNN but no library
* k-means clustering
* Nearest centroid classifier
* Logistic Regression
* Linear Regression
* Hard margin / Soft margin SVMs
  - Getting the support vectors without using scikit learn or LIBSVM
  - SVM with weighted samples  - 
* SVM with Gaussian kernel, using simple NumPy
* Decision Trees
* Linear discriminant analysis
* Image geometric transformations
* L1/L2 regularization
* Feature Selection (No RFE from scikit-learn or PCA)
* A predictive modeling without the use of the gradient descent algorithm for backpropagation
